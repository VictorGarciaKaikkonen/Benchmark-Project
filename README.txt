This is a project I made for fun in my free time.

It has several Java classes, but at the moment the only classes that are being developed are Main.java and Full_CPU_Test.java

There are several magical numbers and some other bad practices involved, but this is a project I started long ago that I have recently decided to resume and rectify.

I would appreciate if you posted your results, followed by the model of processor that you are using. I would also love to see your suggestions or corrections.
